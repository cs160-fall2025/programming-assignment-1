      <p>Welcome to CS 160’s first programming assignment!</p>

      <p>
        By the end of this course, you’ll be designing and implementing
        prototypes of Web applications that solve real problems you discover
        from interviewing target users.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you've built with Web technologies before or you’re just
        starting out, these programming assignments will give you practice
        designed to prepare you for your final project.
      </p>

      <p>In this three-part programming assignment, you will:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Practice adding structure to pages using HTML</li>
        <li>Practice writing CSS selectors</li>
        <li>
          Write JavaScript that interacts with the Document Object Model (the
          DOM)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let’s dive in!</p>

      <h2 id="Collaboration">Collaboration policy</h2>

      <p>
        Programming assignments should be your own. You are not allowed to copy
        other students code, or copy/modify large chunks of code or entire
        projects found online (e.g. on GitHub).
      </p>

      <p>
        You are allowed to consult online resources, e.g. Stack Overflow, to get
        answers to specific implementation questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        LLM-based tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are helpful and
        increasingly common in industry, and
        <strong>you may use them</strong> to help you complete assignments, with
        the following caveats:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          You should stick to using AI for line- or function-level edits; do
          <strong>not</strong> paste the entire chunks of the assignment
          description into ChatGPT (it’s pretty obvious when you do this).
          Programming assignments are not quite like real-world software
          development, because we often provide detail in the specification that
          would not normally be written out for you in a real-world project. If
          you use these tools, you should practice the skill of communicating
          with the tools rather than letting the assignment document do this for
          you.
        </li>
        <li>
          We generally describe what we want you to learn from a particular
          exercise. Work through each task with the intention of
          <strong>practicing the skills we mention</strong>; if AI helped you
          get unstuck, do your best to come away with an understanding of the
          concepts targeted by the assignment.
        </li>
        <li>
          When we ask you to think about the design and aesthetics of your
          application,
          <strong>we’re looking for <em>your</em> creative spark</strong>. AI
          can be great for helping you find the right CSS rules to style an
          element, but you should be making your own high-level decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The goal of these assignments is to develop your skills to work
          independently on code implementations. LLMs can be part of this
          process, but when you prompt AI tools to help you write assignment
          code,
          <strong>you should not share the exact prompts you used</strong> with
          other students. This has a similar effect as sharing code, since it
          prevents other students from developing their own skills with the
          tools they are using. Of course, it's always okay to exchange
          high-level advice with your peers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Starter_code">Starter code</h2>

      <p>
        This assignment includes starter code in the
        <code>code</code> directory. You should build on top of this code for
        your assignment submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please do <strong>not</strong> fork the repository on GitHub or upload
        your code anywhere public-facing. Remember, students aren’t allowed to
        directly copy each other’s code for these assignments; if another
        student copies your code, we won’t be able to tell who copied whom, and
        you’ll be on the hook for the plagiarism too!
      </p>

      <h2 id="Submission">Submission</h2>

      <p>
        You will modify the starter code provided to you with the assignment,
        then submit <strong>just your code/ directory</strong> as a zip file to
        Gradescope containing your code submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gradescope will give you a score for the assignment. This assignment is
        fully autograded, although course staff reserves the right to deduct
        points for incorrect completion of the assignment in a way that subverts
        the autograder (<em>e.g.,</em> by hardcoding a solution that passes the
        tests but does not meet the assignment requirements).
      </p>

      <p>Submission file structure:</p>

      <ul>

        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Development_environment">Development environment</h2>

      <p>
        Read the assignment's README.md for instructions on how to run the local
        server; if you've done it right, the URL of this specification document
        you're reading should be http://localhost:6160/specification/index.html.
      </p>

      <p>
        You'll also want to open the <code>code</code> directory of the
        repository in a text editor. We like
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="Autograder">Autograder</h2>

      <!-- TODO -->
      <div class="admonition-info">
        We may not publish this assignment’s autograder right away; keep an eye
        on Ed for updates. You’ll have access to the autograder in advance of
        the assignment’s deadline.
      </div>

      <p>
        The tests for this assignment are included in the starter code
        repository. We recommend trying
        <a href="https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests"
          >Playwright’s interactive debugging UI</a
        >, although much of its value will be apparent only later in the
        semester, when you're building interactive software for the browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tests you run locally are the same tests that will run in
        Gradescope. Still, you should
        <strong>make a test submission to Gradescope early</strong> to make sure
        you know how to submit correctly before the deadline!
      </p>

        <h2>Part 1 · HTML</h2>
        <p>
          <em> Skills: HTML </em>
        </p>

        <p>This exercise is copyright CC BY-SA v2.5, Mozilla Contributors.</p>

        <!-- TODO: maybe we Vite it? -->
        <p>
          Open
          <a href="/code/part1/index.html"><strong>part1/index.html</strong></a>
          in your browser. In HTML, <code>index.html</code> in a directory
          typically refers to the “main” page, named this way because it
          represents the page that often acts as an “index” or table of contents
          for the rest of the directory.
        </p>

        <h2>Task 1</h2>

        <p>
          In this task, we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic
          heading (<code>h1</code>, etc.) and paragraph (<code>p</code>)
          elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open <strong>task1.html</strong>, both in your text editor (like VS
          Code) and your Web browser.
        </p>

        <p>Your final page should look like this:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="./images/part1/task1.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Note that some styling is present in the provided template, which is
          where the purple text comes from.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you've finished, run <code>npx playwright test</code> from within
          the <code>programming-assignment-1</code> directory. You should be
          passing the tests for task 1 of part 1!
        </p>

        <p>
          We've also found the official Playwright extension in VS Code to be
          pretty helpful!
        </p>

        <h2>Task 2</h2>

        <p>
          In this task, we want you to turn the first un-marked up
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Lists"
            >list</a
          >
          into an unordered list, and the second one into an ordered list.
        </p>

        <p>Open <strong>task2.html</strong>.</p>

        <p>Your final page should look like this:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="./images/part1/task2.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
          As before, some styling is already present (that’s where the colored
          borders come from.)
        </p>

        <h2>Task 3</h2>

        <p>
          In this task, we want you to turn the provided animals and their
          definitions into a
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dd"
            >description list</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>Open <strong>task3.html</strong>.</p>

        <p>Your final page should look like this:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="./images/part1/task3.png" />
        </div>

        <h2>Task 4</h2>

        <p>
          In this task, you are provided with a paragraph, and your aim is to
          use some inline elements to mark up a couple of appropriate words with
          <strong>strong</strong> importance, and a couple with
          <em>emphasis</em>.
        </p>

        <p>Open <strong>task4.html</strong>.</p>

        <p>Your final page should look like this:</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="./images/part1/task4.png" />
        </div>

        <h2>Finishing up</h2>

        <p>
          Once you’ve completed all four tasks, make sure the tests are passing.
          Submit all three parts of this assignment together, at the end!

        <h2>Part 2 · CSS selectors</h2>
        <p>
          <em>Skills: locating elements in the page with CSS</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          You <strong>won’t write any code in your editor</strong> for this
          task. Instead, you'll run through <strong>CSS Diner</strong>, a set of
          exercises by <a href="https://github.com/flukeout">@flukeout</a>, used
          under the
          <a href="https://github.com/flukeout/css-diner?tab=MPL-2.0-1-ov-file"
            >Mozilla Public License, version 2.0</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          CSS is a language designed to let you choose particular elements in an
          HTML page, then apply styles to those elements. In this exercise,
          we'll focus on that first part: <strong>selecting elements</strong>,
          in particular on selecting just the elements you want. CSS diner will
          show you various HTML snippets and ask you to write a CSS selector
          that selects certain elements from those snippets.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've curated a subset of the exercises from the CSS diner website
          (the original is at cssdiner.com), so make sure you're completing them
          within our custom version distributed with this homework. If you are
          running the local Web server associated with this assignment (with
          <code>npm start</code>), you can open this version of CSS diner:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <a href="http://localhost:6160/css-diner"
            >http://localhost:6160/css-diner</a
          >
        </div>

        <p>
          When you complete each level, this will save your answer to the
          <code>code/part2/save-data.json</code> file, enabling a new test to
          pass (you'll find these in the same place as the tests for part 1).

          <em>Skills: locating elements in the page with the DOM</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          An HTML document is represented in the browser as a tree data
          structure. This structure can be accessed and manipulated using
          JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (DOM) API.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/grubhub-component-tree.png"
            alt="Grubhub Component Tree"
          />
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 10pt">
          This is a view from my browser's developer tools, showing the DOM
          structure for a widget from the Grubhub website.
        </div>

        <p>
          In this task, you'll be asked to write CSS selectors that select
          various sets of elements from a provided page. Then, you'll write a
          JavaScript function that (without CSS selectors) uses the DOM tree to
          select those same elements.
        </p>

        <p>
          In
          <a href="/code/part3/index.html"><strong>part3/index.html</strong></a
          >, you'll find a document from the
          <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 Up</a> template website. Have a
          look around, and explore the DOM tree using your browser's

          <strong
            >Make sure you're seeing a left sidebar and a main section</strong
          >; you may need to make your browser larger and/or zoom out, since
          this page has a responsive layout and will change its layout when it
          becomes too narrow.

        <div class="image-container">

        <p>
          For each of the below tasks, edit <code>code/part3/solution.js</code>,
          adding a CSS selector that will select all of the required elements on
          the page. We will use <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> with your
          CSS selector to verify that the correct elements are selected.
        </p>

        <p>
          We've added a floating helper panel to the page, which provides
          buttons you can click to highlight the elements selected by your
          current solutions (you'll want to reload the page before trying again,
          when you make a change).
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, for each task, <strong>implement the same selector</strong> with
          pure JavaScript DOM operations.
          <strong>You may not use querySelector or querySelectorAll</strong>;
          instead, use these DOM operations, as needed:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code
              ><a

                >getElementById</a
              ></code

                >getElementsByClassName</a
              ></code
            >

              ><a

                >getElementsByTagName</a
              ></code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentNode"
                >parentNode</a
              ></code
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/childNodes"
                >childNodes</a

          <li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          Tip: each of these can be called not just on the global
          <code>document</code> object, but also on any individual element
          fetched from the DOM. You'll see an example below, when we call
          <code>article.getElementsByClassName</code>. This can help you query
          for elements within a particular scope, rather than searching the
          entire document.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that operations that return multiple elements (like
          <code>getElementsByClassName</code>) return an HTMLCollection or
          NodeList, which is different than a typical list (array) in
          JavaScript. If you're having trouble getting these return values to
          behave, you can convert them to lists:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const elements = document.getElementsByClassName("some-class");
const elementsList = [...elements];

// use elementsList like a normal list</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          We haven't explicitly taught you JavaScript just yet. It's quite a bit
          like other languages you'll have seen in your technical courses! If
          you're in need of a bit more guidance, the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types"
            >MDN</a
          >
          includes some great detail that should help you pick up JavaScript as
          a language.
        </p>

        <h3>Example: author tags</h3>

        <p>
          Each post in the main section (on the right side of the template)
          contains an "author" section, an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say we want to
          <strong
            >select all of these author tags associated with main-section posts,
            except the first one on the page</strong
          >.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/task0-selected.png"
            alt="Visual demonstration of which elements are selected"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          For this first example, we'll go through it together (but you should
          still put this in your submission). You'll complete the subsequent
          tasks on your own. We've chosen a somewhat complex example to start
          with so that you can see how to approach the problem!
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's start by writing a CSS selector. Each of these author tags has
          the <code>author</code> class, so we could try selecting those:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-css">.author</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          This selects too many items, though: it includes author tags not
          associated with the main-section posts! Let's limit the CSS selector,
          adding another selector preceding the <code>.author</code> selector.
        </p>

        <p>
          All posts, including mini-posts, are in an <code>article</code> tag,
          but only some of these have the <code>post</code> class. These are the
          ones we want:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-css">article.post .author</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Great! We're still selecting the first author tag, though, and the
          exercise asked us to avoid that first one. CSS provides a handy
          pseudo-class for this:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-css">article.post:not(:first-of-type) .author</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          That'll do it! That covers the CSS side of things. Now, how do we do
          this in JavaScript, without using the CSS selector?
        </p>

        <p>Well, let's start by getting all the posts:</p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const articles = document.getElementsByTagName("article");
for (let i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
  const article = articles[i];
  if (article.classList.contains("post")) {
    // This is a post!
  }
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now, let's find an author within each post. In this page, the post
          always contains exactly one author tag, so there's no need to handle
          the case where no author is found:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const articles = document.getElementsByTagName("article");
for (let i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
  const article = articles[i];
  if (article.classList.contains("post")) {
    const authorTag = article.getElementsByClassName("author")[0]; // always exists
  }
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          And finally, let's keep track of which tags we've found, skipping the
          first one:
        </p>

        <div style="margin-left: 24px">
          <pre><code class="language-javascript">const selectedElements = [];
let skippedFirst = false;

const articles = document.getElementsByTagName("article");
for (let i = 0; i < articles.length; i++) {
  const article = articles[i];
  if (article.classList.contains("post")) {
    const authorTag = article.getElementsByClassName("author")[0]; // always exists
    if (skippedFirst) {
      // 'push' adds an item to the end of a list
      selectedElements.push(authorTag);
    } else {
      // This is the first one, so we'll skip it
      skippedFirst = true;
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now, the <code>selectedElements</code> list contains exactly the
          elements we selected earlier with CSS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Put this solution code into <code>code/part3/solution.js</code>. The
          CSS selector goes in the <code>task0_cssSelector</code> variable (it's
          just a string), and the JavaScript code goes in
          <code>task0_jsCode</code>. Make sure to return the final list of
          selected elements from the function!
        </p>

        <p>Now, complete the following tasks on your own.</p>

        <h3>Intro section</h3>

        <p>
          In the sidebar on the left, there's a section towards the top with an
          image and some description of the template. Write code that
          <strong>selects this intro section</strong>. (Hint: the section has an
          <code>id</code> attribute!)
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/task1-selected.png"
            alt="Visual demonstration of which elements are selected"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Intro header</h3>

        <p>
          In that same intro section, there's a <strong>header tag</strong> (<em
            >e.g.,</em
          >
          <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, ...). Write code that
          <strong> selects just this header tag </strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/task2-selected.png"
            alt="Visual demonstration of which elements are selected"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Active buttons</h3>

        <p>
          Each button in this template is represented by a styled
          <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.
          <strong>Select all 6 buttons on the page that are not disabled</strong
          >. (There's just one disabled button, the "previous page" button, and
          it has an indication in the markup that it is disabled.)
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/task3-selected.png"
            alt="Visual demonstration of which elements are selected"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>Post titles</h3>

        <p>
          There are three different places in the page where post titles appear:
          in the main content area, in the sidebar with large image previews
          (these are called "mini posts" in the markup), and in the sidebar
          below this without image previews.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Select all 12 elements that directly contain the post
            titles</strong
          >
          (these will all be <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags, located in various
          parts of the page).
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img
            src="images/part3/task4-selected.png"
            alt="Visual demonstration of which elements are selected"
          />
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
